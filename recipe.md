1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the white and brown sugar, salt and melted butter with a whisk until you have a lumpless mixture.
2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla. The mixture should be smoother now.
3. Sift your flour and baking soda, and using a spatula, fold it in with the liquid mixture.
4. Fold in the chocolate chunks and chill the dough for at least half an hour. You may chill it overnight if you desire a stronger flavor in your cookies.
5. Preheat your oven to 180Â°C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Take out the dough and using an ice cream scoop, scoop it onto the parchment paper, leaving each scoop at least 4 inches apart from the other and 2 inches away from the edges of the pan so that the cookies spread evenly.
7. Bake for 12 - 15 minutes ( or until the edges have begun to brown ).
8. Serve your delicious treats after letting them cool.
